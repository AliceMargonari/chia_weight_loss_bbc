  <h1>The Chia Craze</h1>
<br>
<p> Chia, or Salvia hispanica L, is a member of the mint family from Mexico and South America. The flowering plant can sprout in a matter of days, but chia's appeal is in the nutritional punch of its tiny seeds.</p>

<p> With more omega-3 fatty acids than salmon, a wealth of antioxidants and minerals, a complete source of protein and more fibre than flax seed, the seeds have been dubbed a <b> "dieter's dream" </b>, "the running food", "a miracle", and "the ultimate super food", by advocates and athletes. </p>
<p> To chia cheerleaders the seeds do no wrong. They claim chia reduces inflammation, improves heart health, and <b> stabilises blood sugar levels </b>. A few tablespoons are touted as remedying just about anything - without any ill effects. </p>
<p> "If you had to pick just one desert-island food, you couldn't do much better than chia, at least if you were interested in building muscle, <b> lowering cholesterol </b>, and reducing your risk of heart disease; after a few months on the chia diet, you could probably swim home," writes Christopher McDougall in Born to Run, the bestselling book about an ultra-distance running tribe in Mexico who fuel their epic jaunts with the seeds. The book is credited with shining the spotlight on chia as food for athletes. </p>
